# Fruits-360: A dataset of images containing fruits and vegetables #

## Version: 2020.05.18.0 ##

A high-quality, dataset of images containing fruits and vegetables. The following fruits and vegetables are included: 
Apples (different varieties: Crimson Snow, Golden, Golden-Red, Granny Smith, Pink Lady, Red, Red Delicious), Apricot, Avocado, Avocado ripe, Banana (Yellow, Red, Lady Finger), Beetroot Red, Blueberry, Cactus fruit, Cantaloupe (2 varieties), Carambula, Cauliflower, Cherry (different varieties, Rainier), Cherry Wax (Yellow, Red, Black), Chestnut, Clementine, Cocos, Corn (with husk), Cucumber (ripened), Dates, Eggplant, Fig, Ginger Root, Granadilla, Grape (Blue, Pink, White (different varieties)), Grapefruit (Pink, White), Guava, Hazelnut, Huckleberry, Kiwi, Kaki, Kohlrabi, Kumsquats, Lemon (normal, Meyer), Lime, Lychee, Mandarine, Mango (Green, Red), Mangostan, Maracuja, Melon Piel de Sapo, Mulberry, Nectarine (Regular, Flat), Nut (Forest, Pecan), Onion (Red, White), Orange, Papaya, Passion fruit, Peach (different varieties), Pepino, Pear (different varieties, Abate, Forelle, Kaiser, Monster, Red, Stone, Williams), Pepper (Red, Green, Orange, Yellow), Physalis (normal, with Husk), Pineapple (normal, Mini), Pitahaya Red, Plum (different varieties), Pomegranate, Pomelo Sweetie, Potato (Red, Sweet, White), Quince, Rambutan, Raspberry, Redcurrant, Salak, Strawberry (normal, Wedge), Tamarillo, Tangelo, Tomato (different varieties, Maroon, Cherry Red, Yellow, not ripened, Heart), Walnut, Watermelon.

## Dataset properties ##

Total number of images: 90483.

Training set size: 67692 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).

Test set size: 22688 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).

Multi-fruits set size: 103 images (more than one fruit (or fruit class) per image)

Number of classes: 131 (fruits and vegetables).

Image size: 100x100 pixels.

Filename format: image_index_100.jpg (e.g. 32_100.jpg) or r_image_index_100.jpg (e.g. r_32_100.jpg) or r2_image_index_100.jpg or r3_image_index_100.jpg. "r" stands for rotated fruit. "r2" means that the fruit was rotated around the 3rd axis. "100" comes from image size (100x100 pixels).

Different varieties of the same fruit (apple for instance) are stored as belonging to different classes.

## Repository structure ##

Folders [Training](Training) and [Test](Test) contain images for training and testing purposes.

Folder [test-multiple_fruits](test-multiple_fruits) contains images with multiple fruits. Some of them are partially covered by other fruits. This is an excelent test for real-world detection.

Folder [src/image_classification](src/image_classification) contains the python code for training the neural network. It uses the TensorFlow 2.0 library.

Folder [src/image_classification_tf_1.8.0](src/image_classification_tf_1.8.0) contains the old version of the python code for training the neural network. It uses the TensorFlow 1.8.0 library.

Folder [src/utils](src/utils) contains the C++ code used for extracting the fruits or vegetables from background.

Folder [papers](papers) contains the research papers related to this dataset.

## How we created the dataset ##

Fruits and vegetables were planted in the shaft of a low speed motor (3 rpm) and a short movie of 20 seconds was recorded. 

A Logitech C920 camera was used for filming the fruits. This is one of the best webcams available.

Behind the fruits we placed a white sheet of paper as background. 

However due to the variations in the lighting conditions, the background was not uniform and we wrote a dedicated algorithm which extract the fruit from the background. This algorithm is of flood fill type: 
we start from each edge of the image and we mark all pixels there, then we mark all pixels found in the neighborhood of the already marked pixels for which the distance between colors is less than a prescribed value. We repeat the previous step until no more pixels can be marked.

All marked pixels are considered as being background (which is then filled with white) and the rest of pixels are considered as belonging to the object.

The maximum value for the distance between 2 neighbor pixels is a parameter of the algorithm and is set (by trial and error) for each movie.

Pictures from the [test-multiple_fruits](test-multiple_fruits) folder were made with a Nexus 5X phone.

## Results ##

We have run [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) on these data and the results are presented in [this research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321475443_Fruit_recognition_from_images_using_deep_learning).
